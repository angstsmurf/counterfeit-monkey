The soap dispenser is a closed container in the Public Convenience. It is privately-named. Understand "dispenser" or "soap dispenser" as the soap dispenser. Understand "soap" as the soap dispenser when the soap is not visible. It is fixed in place. The initial appearance of the soap dispenser is "A [soap dispenser] hangs beside the mirror." The description of the soap dispenser is "It's the kind where a squeeze will dispense new soap into the sink[if the soap is not in the soap dispenser]. It is also empty[end if]."

Sanity-check taking the soap dispenser when the soap is in the soap dispenser:
	if the subcommand of the soap dispenser matches "soap":
		try squeezing the soap dispenser instead.

Sanity-check taking the sap-dispenser when the sap-liquid is in the sap-dispenser:
	if the subcommand of the sap-dispenser matches "sap":
		try squeezing the sap-dispenser instead.

Instead of squeezing something dispenser-like (called dispenser-thing):
	let soap-like be a content corresponding to a source of dispenser-thing in the Table of Dispensers;
	if soap-like is in the dispenser-thing:
		let target be a random sink in the location;
		if the soap-sap-receptacle-supporter is non-empty:
			now target is the first thing held by soap-sap-receptacle-supporter;
		if target is a sink:
			if a switched on tap (called target tap) is part of the target:
				silently try switching off target tap;
				say "First switching off [the target tap], [we][run paragraph on]";
			otherwise:
				if a switched on tap (called target tap) is enclosed by location:
					say "Fortunately, the faucet below [the dispenser-thing] is not running. ";
			say "We give the dispenser a squeeze. It deposits [a soap-like] in [the target][unless soap-like is a sop] [--] just viscous enough not to drain away instantly[end if].";
		otherwise:
			if target is nothing:
				say "We give the dispenser a squeeze and it deposits [a soap-like] on the floor, the sink having been removed from the area.";
				now target is the location;
			otherwise:
				if target is non-empty:
					emergency-empty target;
					if target is non-empty:
						stop the action;
				say "We give the dispenser a squeeze. It deposits [a soap-like] in [the target].";
		move the soap-like to the target;
	otherwise:
		say "This time nothing much comes out."
