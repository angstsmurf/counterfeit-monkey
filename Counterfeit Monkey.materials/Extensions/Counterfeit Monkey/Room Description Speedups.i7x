Room Description Speedups by Counterfeit Monkey begins here.

Use authorial modesty.

[ This is basically code from Room Description Control (along with one from Tailored Room Descriptions) rewritten in Inform 6 for speed reasons. I'm not sure if the fact that we still include the original extension but replace nearly all of its rules makes things more confusing or less. ]


[When play begins (this is the new mark every thing as unmentioned when play begins rule):
	rapidly set all things not mentioned.

The new mark every thing as unmentioned when play begins rule is listed instead of the mark every thing as unmentioned when play begins rule in the when play begins rules.]

The mark every thing as unmentioned when play begins rule is not listed in any rulebook.

[Before reading a command (this is the new mark everything unmentioned rule):
	rapidly set all things not mentioned.]

[The new mark everything unmentioned rule is listed instead of the mark everything unmentioned rule in the before reading a command rules.]
The mark everything unmentioned rule is not listed in the before reading a command rules.


A description-priority rule (this is the new marking rule):
	rapidly set all things not marked for listing;
	call the new swift rule on everything in scope.

The new marking rule is listed instead of the marking rule in the description-priority rules.


A description-priority rule (this is the new mentioning tedious things rule):
	now the player is not marked for listing;
	rapidly set all contents of player not marked for listing;
	rapidly set all scenery not marked for listing.

The new mentioning tedious things rule is listed instead of the mentioning tedious things rule in the description-priority rules.


A description-concealing rule (this is the new don't mention things out of play rule):
	rapidly set things out of play not marked for listing.

The new don't mention things out of play rule is listed instead of the don't mention things out of play rule in the description-concealing rules.


A description-concealing rule (this is the new ordinary-concealment rule):
	rapidly conceal possessions.

The new ordinary-concealment rule is listed instead of the ordinary-concealment rule in the description-concealing rules.


A scope processing rule for a thing (called n) (this is the new swift rule):
	rapidly set workflag of n.

The new swift rule is listed instead of the swift rule in the scope processing rules.


A description-concealing rule (this is the new concealing parts rule):
	rapidly set all components not marked for listing.

The new concealing parts rule is listed instead of the concealing parts rule in the description-concealing rules.

A description-concealing rule while entering a container (called special-target) (this is the hide possessions of followers when entering rule):
	rapidly hide possessions of followers in special-target.

Section 2 - New Entering and Leaving (in place of Section 2 - Entering and Leaving in Room Description Control by Emily Short)

The new describe contents rule is listed instead of the describe contents entered into rule in the report entering rulebook.

This is the new describe contents rule:
	if the person asked is the player, follow the description-priority rules.

A description-concealing rule while entering a thing (called special-target):
	rapidly set stuff outside special-target not marked for listing.

Section -

[ This one is from Tailored Room Descriptions ]

Rule for giving-surrounding-details-for something (called the special-target) (this is the new standard surroundings rule):
	while a surprising thing (called second special-target) is referenced by the current-paragraph:
		carry out the disclosing contents activity with the second special-target;
		rapidly set all immediate children of the second special-target mentioned.

The new standard surroundings rule is listed instead of the standard surroundings rule in the for giving-surrounding-details-for rulebook.


[ And these from the Standard Rules ]

This is the optimized declare everything initially unmentioned rule:
  rapidly set all things not mentioned;

The declare everything initially unmentioned rule is not listed in the startup rulebook.

The optimized declare everything initially unmentioned rule is listed instead of the declare everything initially unmentioned rule in the turn sequence rulebook.

	(- MyAllNearChildrenSetMentioned({n}); -).


Seen count is a number that varies.
The seen count variable translates into I6 as "seen_count".

The lowest-rank variable translates into I6 as "lowest_rank".

The new loading table rule is listed instead of the loading table rule in the description-priority rules.

A description-priority rule (this is the new loading table rule):
	load seen-table.

To load seen-table:

This is the new table-debugging rule:
	if paragraph-debug-state is 1:
		repeat with N running from 1 to seen count:
			choose row N from the Table of Seen things;
			if the output subject entry is unmentioned:
				say "[output subject entry]: rank [current rank entry][line break]";
				now output subject entry is unmentioned;
			otherwise:
				say "[output subject entry]: rank [current rank entry] (already mentioned)[line break]";
		say "[line break]".

The new table-debugging rule is listed instead of the table-debugging rule in the description-priority rules.
